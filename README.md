This is an example function of how to make an event study graph in stata. 

It uses code posted by Andrew Goodman-Bacon (<https://twitter.com/agoodmanbacon/status/1165643395844493313?s=20>) and code from projects with Ivan Rudik. 

The divorce data come from Stevenson and Wolfers 2006, <http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/data/DivorceData(QJE).zip>.
